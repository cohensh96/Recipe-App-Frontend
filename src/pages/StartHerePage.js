            1.Understanding the Science Behind the Cooking Method
            </h3>
            <div className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
            When developing a recipe, consider the end taste and texture you want to achieve. Knowing this, you can then figure out which essential cooking methods to use.
             You’ll see these reflected in my recipe instructions.
             <b>In general, cooking methods fall into three categories:</b>
             <ul>
              <li>Dry-heat - use fat to cook, or hot air</li>
              <li>Moist-heat - use water or steam</li>
              <li>Combination of both</li>
             </ul>
             When we want a crispy golden crust on halibut, We will use a dry heat pan-searing technique. To quickly cook broccoliand vegetables without losing too much of their nutrients, We will steam them with moist heat. For a fall-off, the bone short rib, sear it in a hot pan with fat, then braise it in a flavorful liquid.

              2.How to Properly Measure Ingredients
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
              In most kitchens, we use cups and spoons to measure volume instead of weight. This works fine with savory recipes, but it’s more of an issue when baking because precise measurements are needed for reproducible results.
Density also comes into play with various foods, especially with different types of flour. Finally, some foods aerate easily or compact with more pressure. All of these things can impact the actual ingredient amounts added to a recipe.

  3.Choosing the Right Cookware
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
  There are so many types of cookware materials that it can feel overwhelming. In my kitchen,We have stainless steel, cast-iron, and nonstick on hand. We also have various size skillets, pots, a wok, and a large dutch oven. Typically an 8, 10, and 12-inch skillet and various saucepans and pots like 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12-quart.

              4. Selecting the Right Cooking Oil
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
              A must-know culinary term, smoke point. This is when the oil or fat begins to break down and visibly produce smoke. It’s important to know how to select the right oil for different cooking methods.
Also, consider the time of cooking, you’ll need a high smoke point oil like peanut for deep frying foods, whereas a lower smoke point fat like butter can be used to finish a dish.

  5.Take Accurate Temperature Readings
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
  Whenever we are cooking We ALWAYS have an instant-read thermometer handy. It’s a quick scientific check, other than using your senses to know if food is done cooking. More importantly, if the doneness is where you want it to be.
We also use a separate oven thermometer. The temperature display on the front panel of your oven can fall out of calibration over time. We’ve made the mistake too many times of trusting my oven screen and the results were disappointing, especially in baked goods or roasting.

              6.Don’t Forget About Carryover Cooking
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
              When you remove food like steaks, chops, and baked goods from the hot cooking environment, the temperature will continue to rise and due to carryover cooking.
For meats, stop cooking when it’s 5 to 10 degrees from the target serving temperature, and let it rest. The only exception is poultry and fish because their muscle structure is less dense and doesn’t retain heat like a ribeye steak.
Pay attention to the instructions for baking treats and bread as carryover cooking is either desirable or needs to be immediately stopped with extra cooling.

  7.Patience pays off- Rest meat!
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
  Resting meat ensures maximum juiciness. Muscle fibers contract and squeezes the moisture out as it cooks. Resting meat before immediately slicing allows them to relax and absorb moisture back in. This process also plays into the carryover concept for certain food, so you can nail that perfect medium-rare temperature for steaks.

              8.Knowing Which Type of Salt to Use
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
              About 99.9% of our recipes use salt because it’s an effective flavor and texture enhancer when used properly. The amounts I provide in our recipes are guidelines, and I encourage you to season to your liking.
There are endless types of salt and they vary in size, color, and flavor. The smaller the granule, the more surface area it has, so it melts faster. For nearly all of my recipes, We use Morton’s coarse kosher salt because they don’t use additives. We also like the taste and how the flakes cling well to meats and vegetables. If you use Diamond brand kosher salt, use about 30% more.
Get into the habit of always tasting your dish throughout the cooking process, especially right before serving.

  9.When to Use Baking Soda vs Baking Powder
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 font-bold">
  These two ingredients frequently get mixed up. because they both contain an alkaline chemical leavening agent called sodium bicarbonate. Which is simply, baking soda. And by itself, it needs an acid like buttermilk to react and bubble. Baking powder, on the other hand, is baking soda PLUS an acid like cream of tartar, and an inert stabilizer like cornstarch to prevent it from reacting in the container.
When to use baking soda vs. baking powder? Baking soda is great to add more spread and crispiness to cookies or when a recipe already has a good amount of acid. I use baking powder (specifically double-acting) for cakes and cookies for extra insurance so that it doesn’t lose all its rising power during mixing.
Baking powder can also help to tenderize meat. It’s a technique often used in Chinese stir-fries to soften tougher cuts, but it also helps to create a crispy crust in baked chicken wings.
